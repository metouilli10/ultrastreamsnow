**Last Updated:** [Month Year]

---

## Our Commitment

At UltraStreamNow, we strive to provide high-quality IPTV services and excellent customer satisfaction. We understand that sometimes things don't work out as expected, and we're committed to handling refund requests fairly and transparently.

This Refund Policy is part of our Terms of Service. By subscribing to UltraStreamNow, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

---

## General Refund Policy

Refunds are provided at UltraStreamNow's sole discretion and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. We aim to be fair and reasonable while protecting our business from abuse.

**Important:** All refund requests must be submitted within **7 days** of the original purchase date to be eligible for consideration. Requests made after this period will not be honored except in extraordinary circumstances.

---

## When Refunds May Be Granted

We may provide a full or partial refund in the following situations:

### Technical Issues We Cannot Resolve

If you experience persistent technical problems that prevent you from using our service, and our support team is unable to resolve the issue after reasonable troubleshooting attempts, you may be eligible for a refund.

Examples include:

- Continuous buffering or streaming issues on our end
- Service completely unavailable or inaccessible due to server problems
- Login or authentication failures caused by our systems
- Major technical glitches that make the service unusable

**What We Require:** You must contact our support team and allow us a reasonable opportunity (typically 24-48 hours) to resolve the issue before requesting a refund.

### Service Unavailability

If our IPTV service is unavailable for an extended period (typically more than 48 consecutive hours) due to issues within our control, we may issue a prorated refund for the downtime.

This does not apply to:

- Scheduled maintenance (typically announced in advance)
- Issues with your internet connection or ISP
- Problems caused by your device or network configuration
- Force majeure events (natural disasters, power outages, etc.)

### Duplicate or Incorrect Charges

If you are accidentally charged twice for the same subscription or charged an incorrect amount due to a billing error on our end, we will promptly refund the duplicate or incorrect charge.

### Service Not as Described

If the service you receive is materially different from what was advertised at the time of purchase (e.g., significantly fewer channels than promised in your plan), you may be eligible for a refund.

### Free Trial Issues

If you were charged during a free trial period when you should not have been, or if you canceled before the trial ended but were still charged, we will refund the charge.

---

## When Refunds Are NOT Provided

To maintain fairness and protect against abuse, we do **not** provide refunds in the following circumstances:

### Change of Mind

We do not offer refunds simply because you changed your mind, no longer want the service, or decided not to use it. We encourage you to take advantage of our free trial (when available) to evaluate the service before committing to a paid subscription.

### Content Dissatisfaction

Refunds are not provided if you are dissatisfied with:

- The available channels, movies, or series
- Specific content quality or selection
- Content that was removed or changed after your purchase
- Regional content availability differences

We provide detailed information about our channel lineup and content on our website. Please review this information before subscribing.

### User Error or Misuse

Refunds are not available for issues caused by:

- Incorrect login credentials or forgotten passwords
- Using an incompatible or unsupported device
- Poor internet connection or bandwidth issues on your end
- Failure to follow setup instructions or recommended configurations
- Sharing your account with others in violation of our Terms of Service

### Failure to Cancel Auto-Renewal

If you forget to cancel your subscription before it automatically renews, you are still responsible for the charge. We do not provide refunds for auto-renewal charges.

**Note:** You can cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings to prevent future charges. Cancellation must be completed before the renewal date.

### Partial Period Refunds

If you cancel your subscription mid-cycle, you will retain access to the service until the end of your current billing period, but no refund will be issued for the unused portion of that period.

### Violations of Terms of Service

If your account is suspended or terminated due to violations of our Terms of Service (such as account sharing, unauthorized reselling, fraudulent activity, or other prohibited conduct), you will not be entitled to any refund.

### Third-Party Payment Processor Fees

We are not responsible for fees charged by third-party payment processors (such as currency conversion fees, international transaction fees, or cryptocurrency processing fees). These fees are non-refundable.

### Refunds Already Processed

If you have already received a refund for a previous issue or subscription period, additional refunds may not be granted except in exceptional circumstances.

---

## Refund Amount and Processing

### Refund Amount

Depending on the circumstances, we may issue:

- **Full Refund:** 100% of the subscription fee is returned
- **Partial Refund:** A prorated amount based on the unused service period or severity of the issue
- **Account Credit:** In some cases, we may offer account credit instead of a cash refund

The refund amount is determined at our discretion based on the nature of the issue and how long you've had access to the service.

### Processing Time

Once a refund is approved:

- **Credit/Debit Cards:** Refunds are typically processed within 5-10 business days. The exact time depends on your bank or card issuer.
- **PayPal:** Refunds are usually processed within 3-5 business days.
- **Cryptocurrency:** Due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions, crypto payments are generally non-refundable. In exceptional cases, we may provide account credit or process a refund in USD equivalent.

**Note:** We initiate the refund as soon as it's approved, but we cannot control how long your bank or payment provider takes to process it.

### Refund Method

Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. If the original payment method is no longer valid or available, please contact us to arrange an alternative refund method.
